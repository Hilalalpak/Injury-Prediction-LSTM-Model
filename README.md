## 📋 Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive sports injury risk analysis system using machine learning techniques. The system analyzes athlete data to predict injury risks and provide actionable insights for injury prevention.

### 🎯 Key Features

- Individual athlete risk profiling
- Real-time injury risk prediction using LSTM networks
- Workload analysis and optimization
- Performance metric tracking
- Comprehensive statistical analysis

## 📊 Data Sources

The project utilizes three main datasets collected between May 2016 and April 2018:

1. **Metrics Dataset**: Contains hip mobility and groin squeeze measurements
2. **Workload Dataset**: Game-specific performance and exertion metrics
3. **Injuries Dataset**: Complete injury tracking system data

## 🛠 Technical Architecture

### Data Processing Pipeline
```python
- Data Integration
- Feature Engineering
- Time Series Preparation
- Model Training
- Risk Assessment
```

### Key Components

- **LSTM Model**: Deep learning model for risk prediction
- **Early Stopping**: Prevents overfitting during training
- **Individual Models**: Separate models for each athlete
- **Risk Scoring System**: Comprehensive risk assessment

## 📈 Features

- `workload_7d`: 7-day cumulative workload
- `acwr`: Acute:Chronic workload ratio
- `workload_change`: Daily workload change percentage
- `hip_trend`: Mobility metrics trends
- `groin_trend`: Strength metrics trends
- `injuries_30d`: 30-day injury history
- `overall_risk`: Combined risk score

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
```

## 📊 Results

The model demonstrates varying performance across different athletes:
- Strong predictive accuracy for athletes with consistent training patterns
- Higher deviation in predictions for athletes with irregular workload patterns
- Successfully identifies high-risk periods and workload-related risk factors

## 📝 Key Findings

1. Workload patterns significantly impact injury risk
2. Individual athlete responses vary considerably
3. Hip mobility shows positive correlation with injury prevention
4. Rest periods are crucial for risk management
